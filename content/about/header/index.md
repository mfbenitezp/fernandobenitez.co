I'm Fernando Benítez-Paez, thank you for taking the time to visit my website. I am Colombian-Spanish GIScience researcher. Currently working as Research Associate at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) as part of the [AI for science and government (ASG)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/asg) iniciative, particularly working in the [Shocks and Resilience](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/shocks-and-resilience) to develop spatial modelling methods that can be integrated within the epidemiologic-socio-economic models in order to tackle policy questions that are relevant at the sub-national level. 

In 2020 I hold a research fellowship at the [University of Jaume I](https://www.uji.es/), supported by the Government of Spain and the European Social Fund (ESF) to use machine learning tecniques to characterize the urban mobility patterns in medium-size cities using remote sensing data sources. Previously I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) in Scotland, developing a data fusion method to annotate Earth’s magnetic field data from satellite and terrestrial sources to GPS trajectories - [MagGeo](https://github.com/MagGeo/MagGeo-Annotation-Program).

I have experience in the geospatial tecnologies sector as former development and business partner manager, and head of geographic innovation team in [Esri-Colombia](https://esri.co/). I have a bachelor degree as Cadastral and Geodesy engineer

I have experience in GIS deployment, spatial analysis, remote sensing,  open data, well government, and citizen engagement. Working with several local authorities in multiples countries, especially in South America and Europe. Passionate about GIScience research, machine learning techniques, data fusion methods, 2D/3D visualization tools, spatial analysis. My aim is to help public administrations and private organizations to transform ideas into real solutions through spatial data and remote sensing.
