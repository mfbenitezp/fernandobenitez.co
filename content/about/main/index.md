  Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. I am Colombian-Spanish researcher. Currently working as Lecturer in Spatial Data Science at the [School of Geography and Sustenable Development](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/geography-sustainable-development/) in [The University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/). 
  
  My research sits at the intersection of **Urban Analytics**, **Geography** and **Computer Science**. I'm interested in developing new spatially enriched computational methods to better understand the relationship between human behaviors (in some cases movement or interactions) and their environmental impact. My work has been focused in the potential of spatial data and the integration with other type and traditional forms of data to provide evidence of urban dynamics but with a particular emphasis on inform policy making.

  Previously, I worked as research associate in 2021 at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) as part of the [AI for science and government (ASG)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/asg) initiative, particularly working in the [Urban Analytics Team](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/urban-analytics) & [Shocks and Resilience](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/shocks-and-resilience) to develop spatial modelling methods that can be integrated within the epidemiologic-socio-economic models to tackle policy questions that are relevant at the national or local level.
  
  I did my PhD in Geoinformatics (obtained in 2018) at the [Universitat Jaume I](https://www.uji.es/) - Spain, under the supervision of [Dr Joaquín Huerta](http://www.huerta.name/). In 2020, I held a research fellowship at the [University of Jaume I](https://www.uji.es) to use machine learning techniques to characterize the urban mobility patterns in medium-size cities using remote sensing data sources. In 2019, I worked with [Dr Urška Demšar](https://udemsar.com/) as a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/), to develop a novel data fusion method to annotate Earth’s magnetic field data from satellite and terrestrial sources to GPS trajectories - [MagGeo](https://github.com/MagGeo/MagGeo-Annotation-Program).
  
  I also have experience in the private sector, as I worked for several years as former development and business partner manager, and head of geographic innovation team in [Esri-Colombia](https://esri.co/).
  
  Learn more about my research interests and publications in the research and project sections. Contact me if you wish to collaborate, contribute or have a chat about a particular nice idea related to my research interests.
