  Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. I am Colombian-Spanish GIScience researcher. Currently working as research associate at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) as part of the [AI for science and government (ASG)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/asg) iniciative, particularly working in the [Shocks and Resilience](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/shocks-and-resilience) to develop spatial modelling methods that can be integrated within the epidemiologic-socio-economic models to tackle policy questions that are relevant at the national or local level.
  
  I have a PhD in Geoinformatics (obtained in 2018) from the [Universitat Jaume I](https://www.uji.es/) - Spain, under the supervision of [Dr Joaquín Huerta](http://www.huerta.name/). In 2020, I held a research fellowship at the [University of Jaume I](https://www.uji.es) to use machine learning techniques to characterize the urban mobility patterns in medium-size cities using remote sensing data sources. In 2019, I worked with [Dr Urška Demšar](https://udemsar.com/) as a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) - Scotland, to develop a novel data fusion method to annotate Earth’s magnetic field data from satellite and terrestrial sources to GPS trajectories - [MagGeo](https://github.com/MagGeo/MagGeo-Annotation-Program).
  
  Previously, I worked in the geospatial technologies sector as former development and business partner manager, and head of geographic innovation team in [Esri-Colombia](https://esri.co/).
  
  My research interests include spatial data analysis, data fusion methods, urban analytics and the science of movement. Learn more about my research interests and publications.
