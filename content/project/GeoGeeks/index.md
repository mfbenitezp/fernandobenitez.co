excerpt: Head of the geographic innovation group called "Semillero de Innovación geográfica - SIG", I lead over 12 developers and GIS engineers to deploy GIS apps, using the latest Esri’s SDK and APIs. In over a year we could test and deploy over 100 applications using the web and mobile Esri frameworks. The aim of this group was to combine new and stunning web desing techniques with the most innovate features from the Esri API, GIS builders and Mobile SDKs.

### Project description 

The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted how vulnerable societies and governments are to shocks. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the propensity to design policy for narrow silos relating to singular policy areas and government departments, without adequate consideration of the interdependencies between them and the interconnected nature of local and global societies. The pandemic has brought into focus the fact that resilience in one policy area (e.g. health) can come at the cost of resilience in another (e.g. the economy). The overall aim of this large-scale, 2-year research project is to develop a better understanding of resilience in interconnected health, social, and economic systems and to use this understanding to identify robust policy measures.

### My role

During the last two years working in Esri Colombia, I was the head of the group named as SIG-Semillero de Innovación Geográfica (in Spanish). My role was to manage the budget and people from the GIS services sector, performing GIS projects, in several Colombian public and private organizations developing web and mobile applications. Over two years the innovation team was created using bachelor students with GIScience skills, designers and developers to set up small groups that help Esri to deploy new, innovative and out of the box applications showing the potential of Esri’s developer platform.
