excerpt: Head of the geographic innovation group called "Semillero de Innovación geográfica - SIG", I lead over 12 developers and GIS engineers to deploy GIS apps, using the latest Esri’s SDK and APIs. In over a year we could test and deploy over 100 applications using the web and mobile Esri frameworks. The aim of this group was to combine new and stunning web desing techniques with the most innovate features from the Esri API, GIS builders and Mobile SDKs.
