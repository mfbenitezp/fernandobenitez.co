summary: 'We developed a novel data fusion method that helps researchers link Earth magnetic field data from satellites to GPS trajectories of tracked animals. This paper describes the technical process to of combining geomagnetic data (from European Space Agency Swarm satellites) with animal tracking data using a new spatio-temporal interpolation method. The tool was developed in Python. This is the first tool of this kind, and we hope it can help ecologists better understand how wildlife response to short-term variations on the geomagnetic field.'

## Abstract
Migratory animals use information from the Earth's magnetic field on their journeys. Geomagnetic navigation has been observed across many taxa, but how animals use geomagnetic information to find their way is still relatively unknown. Most migration studies use a static representation of geomagnetic field and do not consider its temporal variation. However, short-term temporal perturbations may affect how animals respond-to understand this phenomenon, we need to obtain fine resolution accurate geomagnetic measurements at the location and time of the animal. Satellite geomagnetic measurements provide a potential to create such accurate measurements, yet have not been used yet for exploration of animal migration.
