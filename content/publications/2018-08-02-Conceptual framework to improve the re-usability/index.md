## Abstract
Open data has a profound effect on the working environment within which information is created and shared at all levels. At the local government level, open data initiatives have resulted in higher transparency in policy, a greater engagement between decision-makers and citizens, and have changed the culture about how data analysis and evidence are used to support local governance. This article, based on data collected through an on-line survey, participatory workshops with data user communities in four cities (in Colombia and Spain), and interviews with Valencia good-government office, identifies four elements for a conceptual framework to improve the re-usability of open geographic data in cities. The essential elements defined in this research are the definition of data user communities and their needs, the creation of the community of reuse, user-focused metadata, and reuse-focused legal terms. The definition of these indicators provides a framework for authorities to re-shape their current open data strategy to include data user requirements. At the end of this article, a roadmap for future research and implementation is presented, considering some reflections on the conceptual framework.
