description: I am Lecturer in Spatial Data Science in the [School of Geography & Sustainable Development](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/geography-sustainable-development/)  at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/), Scotland. I use GIScience and data science tools to develop new methods for spatio-temporal problems, with a particular focus on data fusion methods and urban analytics. My current research focuses on develop spatial modelling methods that can be integrated within the epidemiologic-socio-economic models to tackle national and local policy questions.
