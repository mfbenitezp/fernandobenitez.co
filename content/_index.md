description: I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) in London - United Kingdom. I use GIScience and data science tools to develop new methods for spatio-temporal problems, with a particular focus on data fusion methods and urban analytics. My current research focuses on develop spatial modelling methods that can be integrated within the epidemiologic-socio-economic models to tackle national and local policy questions.
