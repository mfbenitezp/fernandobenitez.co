      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been leveraging GitHub Pages for publishing. This works great, but for blogdown we&amp;rsquo;ll start using Netlify. Let&amp;rsquo;s start RIGHT NOW with a site we&amp;rsquo;ve already built and published.
Pre-requisites     Pick either your postcards site, or your distill site from day 01. Refresh your memory- which repository was it again?</description>

      <title>Fusion of wildlife tracking and satellite geomagnetic data for the study of animal migration</title>

      <description>We developed a novel data fusion method that helps researchers link Earth magnetic field data from satellites to GPS trajectories of tracked animals. This paper describes the technical process to of combining geomagnetic data (from European Space Agency Swarm satellites) with animal tracking data using a new spatio-temporal interpolation method. The tool was developed in Python. This is the first tool of this kind, and we hope it can help ecologists better understand how wildlife response to short-term variations on the geomagnetic field.</description>

      <description>Project description     The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted how vulnerable societies and governments are to shocks. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the propensity to design policy for narrow silos relating to singular policy areas and government departments, without adequate consideration of the interdependencies between them and the interconnected nature of local and global societies. The pandemic has brought into focus the fact that resilience in one policy area (e.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Mechanisms of Migratory Bird Navigation with Big Data Analytics.</title>
      <link>https://fernandobenitez.co/project/uncovering-the-mechanisms-of-migratory-bird-navigation/</link>

      <guid>https://fernandobenitez.co/project/uncovering-the-mechanisms-of-migratory-bird-navigation/</guid>
      <description>Project description     Migratory birds are capable of amazing feats of navigation, yet our understanding of how they do this remains fairly rudimentary. We explore how birds use Earth’s magnetic field for navigation in a novel data science approach to ecology. For this, we will connect bird tracking data from over 60 studies with geomagnetic data from satellites and terrestrial networks, to, for the first time, find out about the actual geomagnetic conditions that the birds experienced during their journeys.</description>

      <title>Establishing the integrated science of movement: bringing together concepts and methods from animal and human movement analysis</title>
      <link>https://fernandobenitez.co/publications/2021-03-25-establishing-the-integrated-science-of-movement/</link>

      <guid>https://fernandobenitez.co/publications/2021-03-25-establishing-the-integrated-science-of-movement/</guid>
      <description>Movement analysis has become an integral part of many disciplines, yet with relatively little overlap. A foresight paper in this journal entitled “Towards an integrated science of movement: converging research on animal movement ecology and human mobility science” argued for a better integration of concepts across the divide of animal and human movement, which would lead to the Integrated Science of Movement.</description>

      <guid>https://fernandobenitez.co/publications/2021-01-08-openness-a-key-factor-for-smart-cities/</guid>
      <description>Openness in smart cities incorporates three key dimensions &amp;ndash; transparency, participation, and collaboration &amp;ndash; which affect various domains such as data processing or service provision. Using examples from ongoing and previous research, this chapter also discusses how to realize openness in practice and what benefits and drawbacks can result from different degrees of openness. Based on these considerations, a number of key issues are highlighted that are important to take into account in the design of smart cities and in the transformation process towards a sustainable, smart, and open city.</description>

      <description>This article, based on data collected through an on-line survey, participatory workshops with data user communities in four cities (in Colombia and Spain), and interviews with Valencia good-government office, identifies four elements for a conceptual framework to improve the re-usability of open geographic data in cities.</description>

      <title>Roadblocks Hindering the Reuse of Open Geodata in Colombia and Spain: A Data User’s Perspective</title>

      <description>This article suggests a taxonomy of these barriers for Colombia and Spain, based on a literature review, an online questionnaire, and workshops conducted in four cities of these two countries. The taxonomy highlights that issues such as outdated data, low integration of data producers, published data being difficult to access, misinterpretation and misuse of released data and their terms of use are the most relevant from the data consumer’s point of view.</description>

      <title>Situation Goodness Method for Weighted Centroid-Based Wi-Fi APs Localization</title>

      <description>The paper describes the testing location and the used Wi-Fi fingerprints database. That database is used to create new databases that recreate different sampling possibilities through a samples deletion strategy. The original database and the newly created ones are then used to evaluate the localization results of several AP localization methods and the new method proposed in this paper.</description>

      <description>Project description     Migratory birds are capable of amazing feats of navigation, yet our understanding of how they do this remains fairly rudimentary. We explore how birds use Earth’s magnetic field for navigation in a novel data science approach to ecology. For this, we will connect bird tracking data from over 60 studies with geomagnetic data from satellites and terrestrial networks, to, for the first time, find out about the actual geomagnetic conditions that the birds experienced during their journeys.</description>

      <description>Project description     Esri Colombia is the official distributor of the ArcGIS platform in Colombia., for more than 40 years, this company has been the leading GIS consultant and commercial distributor of ArcGIS. Currently, this Colombian-based company is also distributing ArcGIS in Ecuador and Panama. I started working there as a support engineer till I reached the development program manager position. During this role, we promote the Esri development platform and business models that Esri and ArcGIS offer to consultancies or companies that might complement their portfolio using or reselling the ArcGIS products.</description>

      <title>Ensembles of indoor positioning systems based on fingerprinting: Simplifying parameter selection and obtaining robust systems</title>

      <description>Selecting the appropriate parameters for an indoor positioning system may be a difficult task due to the large number of parameter combinations. It is more complex in realistic multi-building multi-floor environments, where severe wrong building and floor errors occur but they are not highlighted in the main evaluation metric. Moreover, a selected parameter configuration, that may seem appropriate in the system validation, may not have the expected behaviour in a real deployment. In order to address these issues, an ensemble of indoor positioning systems is introduced. A base estimator with 2.332 parameter combinations has been used. According to the results, this model simplifies the parameter selection and provides more robust systems.</description>

      <description>Tachyons is a design system that allows you to design gorgeous interfaces in the browser with little effort.      Because Speed     Building this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic (or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons. It&amp;rsquo;s a design system that provides very small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML. So, rather than writing every line of CSS, you apply the style you need as you write your HTML with easy to understand shorthand class names.</description>
