      <description>We developed a novel data fusion method that helps researchers link Earth magnetic field data from satellites to GPS trajectories of tracked animals. This paper describes the technical process to of combining geomagnetic data (from European Space Agency Swarm satellites) with animal tracking data using a new spatio-temporal interpolation method. The tool was developed in Python. This is the first tool of this kind, and we hope it can help ecologists better understand how wildlife response to short-term variations on the geomagnetic field.</description>

      <description>Tachyons is a design system that allows you to design gorgeous interfaces in the browser with little effort.      Because Speed     Building this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic (or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons. It&amp;rsquo;s a design system that provides very small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML. So, rather than writing every line of CSS, you apply the style you need as you write your HTML with easy to understand shorthand class names.</description>
